# Who's On Call

**Who‚Äôs On Call** is a role-based on-call scheduling and directory platform for hospital departments. Built with modern web technologies, it provides a secure, flexible, and intuitive interface for managing provider shifts.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth with custom roles (`scheduler`, `admin`)
- **Email**: Resend (transactional) for approval notifications (migrated from legacy EmailJS)
- **UI**: Calendar views, modals, responsive sidebars, Framer Motion animations

## üì± Core Features

- **Real-Time On-Call Schedule Viewer**: Monthly calendar interface showing scheduled providers with contact cards.
- **Provider Assignment Modal**: Add/edit on-call providers per day with specialty and healthcare plan filters.
- **Multi-Day Scheduling**: Assign providers to multiple days using a mini-calendar.
- **Directory Integration**: Fetch provider contact info from Supabase.
- **Resident Phone Logic**: Displays alternate numbers based on specialty.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Styled for light and dark themes.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## üîê Access Control

- **Role-Based Access**: Only users with specific `provider_type` (e.g., `scheduler`, `admin`) can modify schedules.
- **Row-Level Security**: Enforced via Supabase policies.

## üíæ Data Integrity

- **Atomic Scheduling**: Prevents duplicate provider entries per day/specialty/HCP.
- **Color-Coded Providers**: Consistent UI colors per provider.
- **Unsaved Changes Tracking**: Tracks modified entries; saves on confirmation.

## üß© Scalability

- Supports multiple specialties and healthcare plans.
- Componentized for future features (e.g., shift notes, analytics).
- API-ready structure for mobile or external integrations.

**Who's On Call** is designed for secure, efficient, and user-friendly on-call schedule management in healthcare environments.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Email Configuration

Set the following environment variables for approval emails (Resend):

```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_key
APP_BASE_URL=https://www.whosoncall.app
APPROVAL_EMAIL_FROM="Who's On Call <no-reply@whosoncall.app>"
APPROVAL_EMAIL_SUBJECT=Access Granted ‚úÖ
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@premuss.org
```

If `RESEND_API_KEY` is missing in non-production environments the API will log a warning and skip sending.

### Admin test email endpoints

Two admin-only endpoints are available to verify the Resend pipeline:

- POST `/api/admin/test-email`
  - Sends a simple HTML/text email.
  - Request body: `{ to: string, useOnboarding?: boolean, subject?: string }`
  - When `useOnboarding` is `true` (default), sender is `onboarding@resend.dev` (allowed only to your Resend account email). Set `useOnboarding: false` to send from your verified domain in dev/prod.

- POST `/api/admin/test-approval-email`
  - Sends the real Approvals React template used in production.
  - Request body: `{ to: string, name?: string }`
  - Uses `APPROVAL_EMAIL_FROM` (or `RESEND_FROM`) as the sender. Defaults to `Who's On Call <no-reply@whosoncall.app>` if unset.

Both endpoints:

- Require an authenticated, approved `admin` user (checked via Supabase).
- Run in the Node.js runtime and are `force-dynamic` (no caching).
- Return JSON with `{ ok, id, to, from }` or `{ ok: false, error, details }` for easier debugging.

Tip: In local dev, Resend‚Äôs onboarding sender can only deliver to your account email. Use a verified domain sender (e.g., `no-reply@whosoncall.app`) to send to external mailboxes like Gmail.

### Sending from the Admin page

- Navigate to `/admin` as an approved admin.
- Use the "Email Pipeline Test" to send a simple test email.
- Use the "Approval Email Test" to send the production approval template.
- Results (success or JSON error) are shown inline under each button.

## üì≤ PWA / iOS Installability

PWA manifest: `public/manifest.json` (replaces older `site.webmanifest`).

Generate iOS light/dark splash screens after updating `public/brand/wordmark.png`:

```bash
npm run pwa:splash
```

Assets are written to `public/splash/light` and `public/splash/dark` and already referenced in `app/layout.tsx`.

Add a maskable icon (optional, Android adaptive shapes): create `public/icon-512-maskable.png` and add to `icons` array in the manifest with `"purpose": "any maskable"`.

See `docs/pwa-ios.md` for validation steps and checklist.
