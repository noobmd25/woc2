# Who's On Call

**Who‚Äôs On Call** is a role-based on-call scheduling and directory platform for hospital departments. Built with modern web technologies, it provides a secure, flexible, and intuitive interface for managing provider shifts.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth with custom roles (`scheduler`, `admin`)
- **Email**: Resend (transactional) for approval notifications (migrated from legacy EmailJS)
- **UI**: Calendar views, modals, responsive sidebars, Framer Motion animations

## üì± Core Features

- **Real-Time On-Call Schedule Viewer**: Monthly calendar interface showing scheduled providers with contact cards.
- **Provider Assignment Modal**: Add/edit on-call providers per day with specialty and healthcare plan filters.
- **Multi-Day Scheduling**: Assign providers to multiple days using a mini-calendar.
- **Directory Integration**: Fetch provider contact info from Supabase.
- **Resident Phone Logic**: Displays alternate numbers based on specialty.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Styled for light and dark themes.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## üîê Access Control

- **Role-Based Access**: Only users with specific `provider_type` (e.g., `scheduler`, `admin`) can modify schedules.
- **Row-Level Security**: Enforced via Supabase policies.

## üíæ Data Integrity

- **Atomic Scheduling**: Prevents duplicate provider entries per day/specialty/HCP.
- **Color-Coded Providers**: Consistent UI colors per provider.
- **Unsaved Changes Tracking**: Tracks modified entries; saves on confirmation.

## üß© Scalability

- Supports multiple specialties and healthcare plans.
- Componentized for future features (e.g., shift notes, analytics).
- API-ready structure for mobile or external integrations.

**Who's On Call** is designed for secure, efficient, and user-friendly on-call schedule management in healthcare environments.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Email Configuration

Set the following environment variables for approval emails (Resend):

```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_key
APP_BASE_URL=https://www.whosoncall.app
